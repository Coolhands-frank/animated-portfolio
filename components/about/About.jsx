                        I'm a Fullstack Developer and Designer based in Nigeria, 
                        passionate about building applications that solve real-world problems and feel great to use. 
                        I have a background in Information Technology and hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
                        from Alex Ekwueme Federal University.
                        When I'm not coding or designing, you'll probably find me deep in a game of Scrabble or plotting 
                        my next chess move. I love a good challengeâ€”whether it's on a board or in a codebase!
